    This project aims to make the pdfs of lecture notes and book drafts scattered all over the internet at random <code>college.edu/~prof/whatever</code> URLs easier to find and recommend to others. I've often encountered instances when some random page of lecture notes from the 4th (!) page of Google search results turned up some insight that the main textbook I'd been studying skipped over. Often, the only way I had of finding them again was going back to my browser history. I thought it'd be nice if, you know, you could actually find thigs somewhat more systematically. (And there went a week.)
    Per Heroku logs, I started making this site on the 7th of October.
